# ft_printf

## DESCRIPTION

We have to recreate the printf() function from libc.

### Requirements Set:
• Do not implement the buffer management of the original printf().
• Your function has to handle the following conversions: cspdiuxX%
• Your function will be compared against the original printf().
• You must use the command ar to create your library.
• Using the libtool command is forbidden.
• Your libftprintf.a has to be created at the root of your repository.
• Your header file must be named ft_printf.h and must contain the prototype of your ft_printf() function.

### New Things I Learnt:
• The printf() function is a variadic function, which can take a variable number of arguments.

## INSTRUCTIONS
• To create the static library, `ft_printf.a`, type in `make` in the terminal.
